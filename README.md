** Real-Time Face and Eye Detection using OpenCV

This project demonstrates a real-time face and eye detection system using OpenCV, a powerful computer vision library. The application uses a webcam feed to identify and track faces and eyes, leveraging pre-trained Haar cascades for accurate and efficient detection.

Features:
  Real-time detection of faces and eyes.
  Visual overlays with bounding boxes for identified regions.
  Customizable detection parameters for sensitivity adjustments.
  Lightweight and efficient for real-time applications.
  
Technologies Used:
   Python: Core programming language.
   OpenCV: Library for computer vision and image processing.
   Haar Cascades: Pre-trained models for face and eye detection.

How It Works:
    Face Detection: Uses Haar cascades to detect faces in the video feed.
    Eye Detection: Performs a secondary pass on the detected face regions to locate eyes.
    Bounding boxes are drawn around detected areas for easy visualization.

Applications:
   Security systems
   Human-computer interaction
   Emotion recognition and more

Conclusion:
  This project serves as a foundation for real-time facial analysis applications. It demonstrates the power of OpenCV in creating            efficient and interactive computer vision systems. Future improvements may include the integration of deep learning models for more robust detection and tracking.
